ðŸ’¬ Quote of the Day: "Relationships are not where we go to have fun. Relationships are where we go to heal and where we go to learn. And who you're going to attract is the person that's going to bring to the forefront the thing you need to learn or heal or the thing that's going to help you grow the most."
